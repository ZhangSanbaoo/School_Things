    "## Conclusion \n",
    "    In this first lab, you learnt to create different types of arrays and to perform basic arithmetic operations on them. You saw that arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result. Another important thing we have seen  that these arithmetic functions are working in the same way on each type of arrays and that there are also specific functions (for the matrices for example)."
